# DeepMemory is designed to offset the weakness of many adaptive optimizers by creating a 'long term' memory of the gradients over the course of an epoch.
# This long term memory is averaged against the current adaptive step size generated from the current mini-batch in order to help guide the step size more optimally.

# DeepMemory also keeps a short term gradient buffer that was developed in diffgrad, and locks down the step size when minimal gradient change is detected.

# 1/1/2020 - @lessw2020 developed the long term memory concept as a blended average (vs max throttle in AdaMod), and created and tested deep Memory
# credits:
# DiffGrad:  Uses the local gradient friction clamp developed by DiffGrad, but with version 1 coded by lessw from the paper:
# https://github.com/shivram1987/diffGrad (S.R.Dubey et al)

# AdaMod - DeepMemory builds on the concepts for longer term monitoring in AdaMod (b3 concept but changed from min throttling to blended average and changed input to len_memory and size):

# AdaMod source and paper link - https://github.com/lancopku/AdaMod/blob/master/adamod/adamod.py

# modifications @lessw2020
# 1/1/20 = instead of b3, change to 'len_memory' and compute b3 (.99 is really 100 memory as 1-(1/100)= .99)
